Log of architectural decisions records (ADRs).

An ADR represents a single architectural decision and its rationale. This repository aims to record all meaningful architectural decisions in a standardized, useful format. The concept of ADRs was formalized by [Michael Nygard](https://www.michaelnygard.com/) and guidance on creating a strong ADR log can be found [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record).
